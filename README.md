# hello-world

Hello GitHub!

Nathan here. I am a student in college, studying Computer Science. 
I am primarily interested in app and video game development, but I also enjoy solving coding challenges.
I am new to GitHub but am hoping to use it to hold future projects and host my portfolio website.
